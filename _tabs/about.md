## About Coffee Powered

Coffee Powered is a space for technical articles, some projects of mine, thoughts on the IT domain/industry, non-IT articles, as well as advice for newer IT professionals and students.

The main idea of this blog is to share what I've learned in this industry, as well as sharing interesting resources, inspiring personalities to follow, events to participate in, and more.

I hope you enjoy your visit and benefit from the articles on here, don't hesitate to share articles on social media if you feel inclined to.

Note that I may not post very often, but will do whenever time/inspiration is available!

## About me

My name is Gabriel. I drink coffee, fumble on my keyboard until it somehow produces something that makes sense and I work as a Linux/Cloud sysadmin in Canada.
