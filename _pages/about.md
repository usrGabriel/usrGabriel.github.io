## About me

Hi there, my name is Gabriel, and I am a Linux system administrator and analyst. In my free time, I like to tinker with technical projects. With or without success, all of them attain the same fundamental result: learning.

With this in mind, along with the amazing blogs that I have read over the years, has prompted me to create my own writing space and give back however I can to the community by sharing some additional knowledge.

## About 'What, Computer?'

'What, Computer?' is a space for technical articles, some projects of mine, thoughts on the IT domain/industry, as well as advice for newer IT professionnals and students.

The main idea of this blog is to learn together in this industry, as well as discussing psychological aspects of the industry, interesting ressources that can be found online, inspiring personnalities to follow, events to participate in, and more. In short, a good amount of variety will be present as I add more articles in this blog.

I hope you enjoy your visit and benefit from the articles on here, don't hesitate to share articles on social media if you feel inclined to.
