## About me

Hi, my name is Gabriel, and I am a sysadmin and junior DevOps engineer. In my free time, I like to dabble in technical projects. With or without success, all of them attain the same fundamental result: learning. This fact, along with all the amazing blogs that I have read over the years, prompted me this create my own little writing space and share some knowledge as well with the community!

## About Erratum

Erratum is pretty much an amalgamation of technical articles, some projects of mine, thoughts on the IT domain/industry, as well as advice for newer IT professionnals/students.

The main philosophy (if it can be called this way) of this blog is to help adopt a better mindset over mistakes we do. In IT, we make mistakes, and some of them can be perceived as terrible and make us hit ourselves in the head while saying "*Why am I so dumb? Why did I do that?*". In my experience, and maybe yours as well, this can cause fear when trying out riskier operations. This blog is here for those who feel the same about the fear of failure, and in fact, adopt the mindset that failure is  synonymous to **learning**, and is beneficial in the long run. In other words, if you are struggling, you are on the right path.

To that end, this blog's technical articles have a particular focus on mistakes, being my mistakes or those of others, they have a dedicated section at the end of most articles I put out. Each mistake is followed with the correction to that mistake, along with details on **why** it happened, what problem it caused, and what the fix does. This is all in order to help understand the subject matter more, as well as seeing real world circumstances, where results are often not functional on the first go.

The way of structuring this blog's articles also explains the reason behind its name, as per the definition of "Erratum":
> [...]\
> **a statement of an error and its correction inserted, usually on a separate page or slip of paper, in a book or other publication; corrigendum.**
