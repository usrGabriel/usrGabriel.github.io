Hello, and welcome to 'Coffee Powered' ☕️

I am excited to start this blog, and I hope I can bring something of value to you with what I will put out on here in the near future.

Here is an idea of what I plan to write:

- Technical articles on Linux system administration, cloud, DevOps and security
- Thoughts/opinions on the industry
- Career advice
- Psychological aspects of an IT career (keeping a positive mindset, avoiding burnout, encouraging a great climate with collegues, etc.)
- Interesting/entertaining ressources
- Events
- Anything else that I may find interesting

For a short self-introduction, my name is Gabriel and I am a sysadmin/junior DevOps engineer. I have been in the industry for 4 and a half years so far, with 2 and a half year doing Linux systems administration full-time.

I am no industry veteran and am very much still enthusiastically learning. I get a lot of my education from prominent figures in the industry which inspired me to keep a technical blog of my own and give back to the community that helped me so much and keep up this great culture of knowledge-sharing that we have in this industry.

Looking forward to providing you with interesting and possibly useful articles!
