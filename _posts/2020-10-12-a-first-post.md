Hello, and welcome to Erratum! ðŸ“•

I am very excited to start out this blog, and I hope I can bring something valuable in your day with what I will put out on here in the near future.

Here is a rough idea of what I plan to write on this blog:

- Technical articles on Linux system administration, cloud, DevOps and security
- Thoughts/opinions on the industry
- Career advice
- Psychological aspects of an IT career (keeping a positive mindset, avoiding burnout, encouraging a great climate with collegues, etc.)
- Interesting/entertaining ressources for learning or having fun!

If you are curious about me, my name is Gabriel and I am a sysadmin/junior DevOps engineer. I have been in the industry for 3 years so far, with 1 year doing Linux systems administration full-time.

I am no industry veteran and am very much still learning and making mistakes, which is the theme of this blog! Most articles that will be written on this blog will include not only a complete guide that is (I hope) clear and concise, but also provide my mistakes as well as other people's mistakes too. Now you might say "Wait... won't this hinder the article with unnecessary text, making it more confusing that it needs to be?", and that is a great question. My solution for this is to put a dedicated section at the end of each article for those.

Another question that you might be asking yourself is "Why would you write mistakes in your blog?". My goal is to help adopt a mindset: embrace mistakes and learn from them. Understand the lessons they convey, and stop the fear of failure that many people are experiencing in IT.

In closing, thank you for reading this very first post. Usually, people are understandably not interested in these (after all, this project is just my own personal thing, why should it interest others by itself?), so your attention is very much appreciated! Looking forward to providing you with something interesting to read! ðŸ˜„
