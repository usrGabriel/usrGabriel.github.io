Hello, and welcome to 'What, Computer?' ðŸ“•

I am very excited to start out this blog, and I hope I can bring something of value to you with what I will put out on here in the near future.

Here is an idea of what I plan to write on this blog:

- Technical articles on Linux system administration, cloud, DevOps and security
- Thoughts/opinions on the industry
- Career advice
- Psychological aspects of an IT career (keeping a positive mindset, avoiding burnout, encouraging a great climate with collegues, etc.)
- Interesting/entertaining ressources
- Events
- Anything else that I may find interesting!

If you are curious about me, my name is Gabriel and I am a sysadmin/junior DevOps engineer. I have been in the industry for 3 and a half years so far, with 1 and a half year doing Linux systems administration full-time.

I am no industry veteran and am very much still (enthusiastically) learning. I get a lot of my education from prominent figures in the industry which inspired me to keep a technical blog of my own and give back to the community that helped me so much and keep up this wonderful culture of knowledge-sharing that we have in this industry!

In closing, thank you for reading! Usually, people are understandably not interested in these first posts (after all, this project is just my own personal thing, why should it interest others by itself?), so your attention is very much appreciated.

Looking forward to providing you with something interesting to read! ðŸ˜„
